Feb-17 Redesign project. It was shut down by Richard Cross. saddest day of our lives. Until tam mentioned the meal planning application, sergios face lit up like a christman tree. SO DID MINE.

Feb-19th Healthy Helper started. Profile class was created with data fields of person's info. The bodyType class was also created to be the parent of every profile class. The body type class is to specify what type of routine based on a person body type. We added getters and setters in the profile class and a set BMI method. We put the BMI method in the profile constructor (String bType, String name, int weightPounds, int heightInches).

Feb-25th First two scenes of the UI were implemented. Body type quiz was started. Body type quiz is used to gather the user's data. This quiz will consist of 4 question that will determine the user's workout routine, body mass index(BMI), height and weight, and their body type goal which could be to cut, shred, or simply maintain. 

Mar-4th food class was added, with data fields for macro nutrients inorder for an array list of food to be made in future class

Mar-5th UI was updated to now have 3 scenes starting with the introduction(which is a simple login to get the user's name), scene 2 where the user is asked to input their height and weight, and scene 3 where the user is asked how frequent they exercise. 

Mar-8th the Schedule class was added for future implementation to display for the user eating routine, the info.txt text file was also added to keep track and record information form the user and write future info from the user.

Mar-11th the UI was updated, the quiz format is fully complete for front end and the start of food menu and main menu was also created.

Mar-12th The UI was updated again with working front and back end for the user's starter quiz to record their information.
