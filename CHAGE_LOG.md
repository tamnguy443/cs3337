Feb-17 Redesign project. It was shut down by Richard Cross. saddest day of our life. Until tam mentioned the meal planning application, sergios face lit up like a christman tree. SO DID MINE.

Feb-19th Healthy Helper started. Profile class was created with data fields of person's info. The bodyType class was also created to be the parent of every profile class. The body type class is to specify what type of routine based on a person body type. We added getters and setters in the profile class and a set BMI method. We put the BMI method in the profile constructor (String bType, String name, int weightPounds, int heightInches).
